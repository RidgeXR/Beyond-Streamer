Very much a WIP. At any given point this will very likely not work. This repo is more for me to collect my thoughts than to publish working builds as of now. To anybody seeing this, Hi!! :3

Update: So ALXR is kinda fucked by default now, this fork will serve as me trying to fix it, I guess. I don't know Rust or C++, this'll be rough going lmao
